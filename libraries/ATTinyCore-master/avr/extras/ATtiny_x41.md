The ATtiny x41 series is a more advanced version of the ATtiny 84. It is pin compatible, though available only in surface mount packages, and offers an incredible array of peripherals, whilst costing only slightly more than an ATtiny 84. Tests have shown that despite manufacturer spec'ed max speed of 16mhz, they typically work without issue at 20mhz @ 5v and room temperature.

### Optiboot Bootloader
This core includes an Optiboot bootloader for the ATtiny841/441, operating on the hardware UART0 (Serial) port at 115200 baud for 12mhz or higher, or 57600 when running at lower speeds. The bootloader uses 640b of space, leaving 3456 or 7552b available for user code. In order to work on the 841, which does not have hardware bootloader support (hence no BOOTRST functionality), "Virtual Boot" is used. This works around this limitation by rewriting the vector table of the sketch as it's uploaded - the reset vector gets pointed at the start of the bootloader, while the EE_RDY vector gets pointed to the start of the application (versions of the core prior to 1.2.0 used WDT vector, so WDT cannot be used as an interrupt - we recommend burning bootloader with the new version if this is an issue). A version of the bootloader that operates on Serial1 is included in the bootloaders folder, though you will have to program it manually or modify boards.txt to use it.

Programming the ATTiny841 via ISP without the bootloader is fully supported.

### Internal Oscillator voltage dependence
The internal oscillator is factory calibrated to +/- 2%. +/- 2% is good enough for serial communication - however, this spec is only valid below 4v - above 4v, the oscillator runs significantly faster; enough so that serial communication does not work. This would interfere with uploads using the bootloader - to work around this, a version of Optiboot is included built assuming the slightly higher operating frequency; this will be used if you select the >4.0v operating voltage prior to doing Burn Bootloader. Although this fixes uploads, it is an awkward workaround: Uploads won't work below 4v, and it doesn't address the issue within the sketch - for this reason is recommended to use a crystal when using the serial ports above 3.3v.

### I2C Support
There is no I2C master functionality implemented in hardware. As of version 1.1.3, the included Wire.h library will use a software implementation to provide I2C master functionality, and the hardware I2C slave for slave functionality, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for Wire.h with the caveat that clock speed cannot be set.

### SPI Support
There is hardware SPI support. Use the normal SPI module.

### UART (Serial) Support
There are two hardware serial ports, Serial and Serial1. It works the same as Serial on any normal Arduino - it is not a software implementation.

To use only TX or only RX channel, after Serial.begin(), one of the following commands will disable the TX or RX channels (for Serial1, use UCSR1B instead)
```
UCSR0B &=~(1<<TXEN0); // disable TX
UCSR0B &=~(1<<RXEN0); // disable RX
```


### Purchasing ATTiny841 Boards
I (Spence Konde / Dr. Azzy) sell ATtiny841 boards through my Tindie store - your purchases support the continued development of this core.
