### Optiboot Bootloader
This core includes an Optiboot bootloader for the ATtiny85/45, operating using software serial at 19200 baud - the software serial uses the AIN0 and AIN1 pins (see UART section below). The bootloader uses 640b of space, leaving 3456 or7552b available for user code. In order to work on the 85/45, which does not have hardware bootloader support (hence no BOOTRST functionality), "Virtual Boot" is used. This works around this limitation by rewriting the vector table of the sketch as it's uploaded - the reset vector gets pointed at the start of the bootloader, while the EE_RDY vector gets pointed to the start of the application.

Programming the ATTiny85/45 via ISP without the bootloader is fully supported; the 24 is supported only for ISP programming.

### PLL Clock
The ATtiny x5 series parts have an on-chip PLL. This is clocked off the internal oscillator and nominally runs at 64mhz when enabled. As a result, it is possible to clock the chip off 1/4th of the PLL clock speed, providing a 16MHz clock option without a crystal (this has the same accuracy problems as the internal oscillator driving it). Alternately, or in addition to using it to derive the system clock, Timer1 can be clocked off the PLL. See below.

### Timer1 Clock Source option
The ATtiny x5 series parts are equipped with a special high speed 8-bit timer, Timer1 (this is very different from the traditional 16-bit timer1 used on the atmega328p and almost every other chip in the 8-bit AVR product line). This timer can be clocked off the system clock (default), OR from the PLL at 64 MHz or 32MHz - this is then fed into the prescaler, which can prescale it by any power of two from 1 to 16384. When opperating below 2.7v, the 64MHz PLL clock source option should not be used and may result in bad behavior. Changing this option will impact the frequency of PWM output on Pin 3, as well as the maximum frequency possible with tone(). See chapter 12 of the datasheet for more information on the high speed timer.

### Tone Support
Tone() uses timer1. For best results, use pin 4 for tone - this will use Timer1's output compare unit to generate the tone, rather than generating an interrupt to toggle the pin. In this way, tones can be generated up into the MHz range. If timer1 is set to use the PLL clock (provided this is done using the menu option, not manually), Tone will figure this out and output the requested frequency. With timer1 running off the PLL @ 64MHz, tone() should be able to output a 32MHz signal on pin 4! If using SoftwareSerial or the builtin software serial "Serial", tone() will only work on pin 4 while the software serial is active. Tone will disable PWM on pin 4, regardless of which pin is used for output. Starting in version 1.2.4, pin 1 will use hardware output compare for tone as well (but PWM on it will not be disabled when tone is in use on a different pin).

### I2C Support
There is no hardware I2C peripheral. I2C functionality can be achieved with the hardware USI. As of version 1.1.3 this is handled transparently via the special version of the Wire library included with this core.

### SPI Support
There is no hardware SPI peripheral. SPI functionality can be achieved with the hardware USI - as of version 1.1.3 of this core, this should be handled transparently via the SPI library. Take care to note that the USI does not have MISO/MOSI, it has DI/DO; when operating in master mode, DI is MISO, and DO is MOSI. When operating in slave mode, DI is MOSI and DO is MISO. The #defines for MISO and MOSI assume master mode (as this is much more common).

### UART (Serial) Support
There is no hardware UART support. If running off the internal oscillator, you may need to calibrate it to get the speed close enough to the correct speed for UART communication to work. The core incorporates a built-in software serial named Serial - this uses the analog comparator pins, in order to use the Analog Comparator's interrupt, so that it doesn't conflict with libraries and applications that require PCINTs.  TX is AIN0, RX is AIN1. Although it is named Serial, it is still a software implementation, so it is recommended to keep the baud rate low, and you cannot send or receive at the same time. The SoftwareSerial library may be used; if it is used at the same time as the built-in software Serial, only one of them can send *or* receive at a time (if you need to be able to use both at the same time, or send and receive at the same time, you must use a device with a hardware UART).

To disable the RX channel (to use only TX), the following commands should be used after calling Serial.begin(). No special action is needed to disable the TX line if only RX is needed.
```
ACSR &=~(1<<ACIE);
ACSR |=~(1<<ACD);
```

### Servo Support
As of version 1.2.2, the builtin Servo library supports the Tinyx5 series. As always, while a software serial port is receiving or transmitting, the servo signal will glitch (this includes the builtin software serial "Serial). This  On prior versions, a third party library must be used. The servo library will disable PWM on pin 4, regardless of which pin is used for output, and cannot be used at the same time as Tone.
